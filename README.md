# GAN  

I used Gan using Generator, Swin Unet, and Discriminator, Resnet50.

At first, I will explain the Networks.

And After that, I  will tell how to use that code and modify the hyperparameters.

## Swin Transformer

There are many models to use as a generator. But we can recognize the fact that a variant of vision transformer models is on the top of ranks. Thus I want to use the "Swin Transformer" as a generator. 

But for anyone who want to use other models as a generator, I will affix other models in "Generators.py" 

First of all, I will explain the concept of vision transformer as a background knowledge of swin transformer and to understand what is the advancements of swin transformer.

  1. Vision Transformer
    
    
  
  2. Swin Transformer
